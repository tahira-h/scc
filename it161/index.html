    <!-- bio</a> Background, skills, goals and accomplishments.-->

    <p>I am a multidisciplinary designer with a passion for taking a product from an idea to reality. My goals are to collaborate with 
      others to grow as a designer over time. My accomplishments include story telling through a product for all users without 
      implicit biases, collaborating well with a team, and leadership.</p>
    
      <p>I received my Master's Degree in 2020, with a focus in Behavioral Sciences, Gender Equity. I learned how to provide equitable services to 
      others in various environments instead of one. I am currently receving a certification in Web Design.</p>

      <p>I am a fan of astronomy and sci-fi. As a creator, in my spare time, I enjoy meditation, finding new recipes to cook, 
        and bake from scratch. </p>

    <p>You may visit <a href="https://github.com/tahira-h" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to view my design work, and message me on
